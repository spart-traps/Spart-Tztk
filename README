this is == Spart's TZTK ==
A fork from Topaz's Minecraft SMP Toolkit - http://minecraft.topazstorm.com/

Similar, but different, from kiloforce's fork, that I just noticed on github:
https://github.com/kiloforce/tztk/

Features:
* add '-wpp' and '-wpp-set' commands : private version of -wp and -wp-set.
  Those waypoints won't appear on cartography software, and aren't usable by other
  players than the one who defined them.
* add '-msg'/ and '-del-msg' : crude mailing system. Syntax : '-msg <username>
  <message>' to send message ; '-msg' to read messages ; '-del-msg' to delete all
  received messages ; '-del-msg <number>' to delete specific message.
* add '-motd' command to display the tztk/motd file in chat
* add '-help' command to display the tztk/help file in chat (you need to
  write the content of this help file.)
* add '-seen <username>' command to display the delay since last connection
  of <username>
* add '-shutdown <delay> <expected-downtime>' a *console only* command to schedule a graceful 
  shutdown of the server after a specified delay in minutes. It will regularly broadcast a
  warning to users of the approach of the shutdown event (every half hour, then 10 minutes,
  then 5, then 1). Use '-shutdown -1' to cancel shutdown.
* add Internationalization framework and french translation - please send me
  more!
* changed 'create' policy : no argument means you get a 64 stack.
* Allow optional restriction of what IP are associated with what  username, so that random 
  people can't steal someone's legit username on offline servers.
  Simply list the allowed IPs or IP  ranges *inside* each of the tztk/whitelisted-players/<username> files.
  e.g: 154.48.9.34
       234.44.
  and only people with the corresponding IP, or with IP matching with
  pattern 234.44.xx.xx will be able to use said username.
